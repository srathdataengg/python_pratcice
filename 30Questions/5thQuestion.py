"""
Python Tuples:- A tuple can have any number if items and they may be of different types(integer,
float,list,string, etc).
tuples can have empty values, can have integersm can have mixed values, nested tuples also.

Difference between list and tuple is that list are mutable but tuples are immutable
tuple are slight memory efficient. if you have data that shouldn't change then go for tuple
